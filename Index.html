      After completing his education, Jinnah started his legal practice in
      <b>Bombay</b> in <b><i>1896</i></b
      >. He quickly became known as a brilliant lawyer and was recognized for
      his expertise in constitutional law. He also served as the
      <b>President of the All India Muslim League</b> from

    <p class="p1">
      Jinnah became increasingly involved in politics and joined the
      <b>Indian National Congress</b> in <b><i>1906</i></b>
      , which was then fighting for India's independence from British rule.
      However, over time, he became disillusioned with the Congress and the
      <b>Hindu-dominated leadership</b>, which he felt was neglecting the
      interests of the Muslim community. This led him to eventually break away
      from the Congress and become a leading figure in the movement for a
      <b>separate Muslim state</b>, which ultimately resulted in the
      <b>creation of Pakistan</b> in <b><i>1947</i></b
